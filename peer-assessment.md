#Automate
##[ ] Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document
Not yet! Fundation of the quarto doc is there and looks great, just need to finalize the methods section and results, for now I am just getting ca rolling mean when I run but the rendering looks awesome!
##[ ] The analysis runs without errors
Meets Spec
##[ ] The analysis produces the expected output
Not yet! The analysis is so close and doing great, its just adding the other nutrient results using facet_wrap or something!
##[ ] Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)
Meets spec! Technically the cleaning is done in scratch/spagetti right? The next step may be to put all the cleaning into a doc in R or Data folder I think and then call it for the Rmd? Im still figuering this out myself lol
#Organize
##[ ] Raw data is contained in its own folder
Meets Spec!
##[ ] Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data
Meets Spec! Technically, but I think this can relate to the data import/cleaning spec as well as the initialization script. My idea was to but these three in one script that is called and ran first at the beginning of the analysis. 
##[ ] At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file
Meets spec! great job!
#Document
##[ ] The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs
not yet! Probably needs to be done last as we arent sure where things are at yet
##[ ] The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works
Not yet! 
##[ ] The code is appropriately commented
Meets Spec! Comments are great! Really concise well written, excellent job!
##[ ] Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention
Meets Spec! So far so good, I'm loving the simplicity, my spaghetti makes like 20 variables its so bad. You do great at commenting things out I can tell the basis of organization is very strong
#Scale
##[ ] Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages
not yet. Making this will help sm with some of the others tho, I also stil have not done this lol
##[ ] The analysis script runs without errors
meets spec! As a wise man once said "its easy to make a script run, its hard to make it run correctly"

Good luck ritchie, honestly was really helpful for me to see you and me are at a very similar place in our progress. I hope this peer assessment is actually helpful because I honestly felt like my project was not in a place to get feedback yet like I just needed to work, but yours is coming together really nicely and im excited to see how it turns out!
