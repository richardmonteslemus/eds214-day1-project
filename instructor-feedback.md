# Exceeds spec


### The student has provided attentive, constructive feedback in a peer review. 
- I believe I have done this because I created a detailed and organized .md file and series of issues for Natalie Bonnet during the peer review. 

### The analysis produces the expected output. 
- I believe I have done this because I created a plot that looks extremely similar to to the original plot. I took great care to learn about techniques such as factoring within facet_grid to even reorder the panel order so it matched that of the original plot. I was able to do this solely through facet_grid as opposed to patch work which allowed me to make cleaner code for the plot (a single chunk of piped code). I believe looking at the ggplot code in my paper.qmd should demonstrate the amount of effort I put into producing this plot with clean code. 

# Collaboration
My peer feedback process with Natalie Bonnet involved commenting suggestions, and pointing out specs that were lacking in an organized way. For example, I recommended in line comments and roxygen skeletons on top of regular section comments. I also added a roxygen skeleton for her with real examples and descriptive text.

Note: I worked on resolving a merge conflict with Ale and it was visible two days ago (lableled resolved) I do not know why I cannot find it anymore. I do have this link however which was a test merge conflict I resolved.
